# Home

**LcdMenu** is an Arduino library that enables you to create interactive menus and navigation systems for LCD displays. With LcdMenu, you can easily add menus to your projects and navigate through them using buttons or any input device you want. The library supports a wide range of LCD display modules, including character and alphanumeric displays.

### ðŸš€ New in LcdMenu 4.0.0 ðŸš€

#### Display Interface Abstraction

* Introduced a new `DisplayInterface` class, which abstracts the display management and makes it easier to integrate different display types without modifying the core logic.
* This interface allows developers to implement custom display adapters, enabling support for a variety of display modules.



#### Improved Modularity and Flexibility

By decoupling the display management logic from the specific hardware, the system is now more modular and easier to extend with new display types.

1. Open the PlatformIO IDE or VSCode with PlatformIO extension installed.
2. Create a new project or open an existing one.
3.  Add the LcdMenu library to your project by adding the following line to your `platformio.ini` file:

    ```ini
    lib_deps =
        forntoh/LcdMenu@^4.0.0
    ```
4. Save the changes to the `platformio.ini` file.
