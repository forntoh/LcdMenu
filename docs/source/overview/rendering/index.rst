Rendering the menu
==================

|project| provides a set of built-in renderers that you can use to display the menu items on different output devices.
The renderers are responsible for drawing the menu items on the screen. They can be customized to suit your needs.

There are lots of opportunities to create your own custom renderer. You can create a renderer for any output device that you like.
For example, you could create a renderer for a TFT display, a touchscreen, or even a 3D printer ðŸ˜„ (the frame rate would be atrocious)

    Renderers can be helpful when you want to customize the appearance of the menu items, such as changing the font size, color, or layout.
