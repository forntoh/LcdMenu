Deep Dive
=========

Let's dive deep into the details of the system.

The first thing you need to know is that the system is built around the concept of a menu screen.
A menu screen is a collection of menu items that are displayed on the screen.
Each menu item can be selected and interacted with by the user.

|project| provides a number of built-in menu items that you can use to create your menu structure.

You can also create your own custom menu items by extending the base menu item class.
