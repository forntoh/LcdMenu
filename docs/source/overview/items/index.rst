Item overview
=============

The first thing you need to know is that the system is built around the concept of a menu screen.
A menu screen is a collection of menu items that are displayed on the screen.
Each menu item can be selected and interacted with by the user.

|project| provides a number of built-in menu items that you can use to create your menu structure.

You can also create your own custom menu items by extending the base menu item class or any of the existing menu items.
