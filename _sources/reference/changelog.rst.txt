**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/forntoh/LcdMenu/compare/4.1.0...4.2.0

LcdMenu 4.1.0
-------------

New Features ⭐️
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **Menu Command Processor Helper for Rotary Encoder** by @forntoh in #185
  A helper function was added to handle menu navigation using a rotary encoder. This makes it easier for developers to implement rotary-based navigation for their LCD menus, streamlining the interaction process. It allows smoother scrolling through menu items and simplifies input with just a rotary encoder.

Enhancements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Examples**: Added [basic rotary encoder](examples/SimpleInput/SimpleInput.ino) and [input rotary](examples/InputRotary/InputRotary.ino) examples to demonstrate functionality.

Bug Fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~~
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused print statements to improve code quality.

LcdMenu 4.0.0
-------------

This release introduces a major refactor of the display management system, aimed at making it more modular and flexible. The key change is the introduction of a display interface abstraction that decouples the display logic from the specific hardware, allowing for easier integration of different display types.

What's Changed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Display Interface Abstraction:
  * A new `DisplayInterface` class has been introduced to define a common interface for all display types.
  * This interface allows developers to easily swap out display implementations (e.g., LCD, OLED) without modifying the core logic.
* Implemented `LiquidCrystalI2CAdapter` to support `LiquidCrystal_I2C` displays.
* Implemented `LiquidCrystalAdapter` to support `LiquidCrystal` displays.
* Improved Modularity and Flexibility:
  * By decoupling the display management logic from the specific hardware, the system is now more modular and easier to extend with new display types.
  * The menu and cursor handling logic has been adapted to work seamlessly with the new interface, ensuring backward compatibility while providing enhanced flexibility.
* Debug mode is now turned off by default

Bug Fixes and Improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Memory Management: Optimized the handling of dynamic memory allocation to prevent memory leaks and improve stability.
- Code Cleanup: Refactored the codebase for better readability and maintainability. Deprecated functions and variables have been removed or replaced with more efficient alternatives.
- Documentation: Updated and expanded the documentation to reflect the new architecture and features.

Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- API Changes: The introduction of the DisplayInterface class and its implementation may require changes to existing projects. Users must update their code to work with the new interface and adapters.
- Some methods and features directly tied to the LiquidCrystal_I2C library have been refactored or removed. Please review [the migration guide](https://lcdmenu.forntoh.dev/reference/migration-guide) for details on how to update your code.

LcdMenu 3.0.0 🚀
---------------

What's new 🚀
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In previous versions of LcdMenu, the menu used a lot of memory since space has to be reserved for every field on the menu even if it is not used, this release fixes that by allowing the user to import only `MenuItems` which is needed.

You can expect to save up to **10%** on memory usage (or even more 😎), depending on which menu item types you use.

There's also a new way to create menus, check the readme.

LcdMenu 2.0.0
-------------

#### What's new 😍

- The callback functions now contain arguments that can be used (for `ItemList` : index `int` is available at the callback execution site, for `ItemInput` : value `string` and for `ItemToggle` : isOn `int` 0 or 1).
  No need to call `menu.getItemAt(menu.getCurrentPosition())` before getting the data you need from the item on callback execution, you already have what you need 😊
- Support for lists of values added. 🥳
- Added `toggleBacklight` function (JIC 🤷‍♂️)
- Examples no longer require `Keypad`, `NeoTimer` and `IRRemote` dependencies (testing is now possible just with serial)

#### Fixed

- Fixed CI workflow.
- Messed up versioning in PlatformIO Library manager 😪 _(now has to start at 2.0.0)_
  _Because I abandoned the feature I was working on in `2.0.0-beta`, it always shows on the top even though it's not the latest version_

LcdMenu 1.2.0
-------------

Abandoned menu generator 😞

LcdMenu 2.0.0-beta.2
--------------------

**What's new**

- Improvements and patches to [v2.0.0-beta.1](https://github.com/forntoh/LcdMenu/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta.1)

LcdMenu 2.0.0-beta.1
--------------------

**What's new**

- Removed build submenu from LcdMenu.
- Eliminated `ItemSubHeader` class (use `ItemHeader(parent)`).
- Memory optimizations.

⭐ NEW: Added menu generator ⭐
